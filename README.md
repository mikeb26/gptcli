# Overview

gptcli is an agentic command-line interface (CLI) tool utilizing LLMs
for user chat sessions and performing automated tasks. It integrates
several capabilities, including command execution, file management,
environment variable manipulation, directory management, web
retrieval, and nested prompting.

# Key Features

- **Create conversations with LLMs:**
  - ChatGPT style conversations within the terminal
  - Persist across multiple executions for later retrieval
  - Can be archived when no longer needed
  - Current and archived conversations fully searchable

- **Automate tasks w/ Agentic Capabilities:**
  - Execute arbitrary shell commands
  - File manipulation: create, append, read, and delete files
  - Environment management: get/set current directory and environment variables
  - Retrieve content from the web

- **User Approval System:**
  - Most actions require explicit user approval. This safeguard
    ensures that potentially dangerous operations cannot be executed
    without user confirmation.

## Examples

### Create a Tetris golang project

`````bash
$ ls tetris
ls: cannot access 'tetris': No such file or directory
$ gptcli
gptcli> new
Enter new thread's name: tetris
gptcli/tetris> create a new golang project implementing a basic version of the classic tetris arcade game. output the results into a new directory 'tetris'. ask me clarifying questions as needed.
gptcli: processing...
Before I begin, could you please clarify a few points about the project?

1. Would you like the Tetris game to run in the terminal (e.g., using a text-based or curses UI) or as a windowed application with a graphical interface?
2. If windowed, do you have a preference for a specific graphics library (such as SDL, Pixel, or others) for Go?
3. Are there any specific features or gameplay mechanics you want to include? For example: piece rotation, hard drops, scoring, level progression, etc.
4. Should the project include sound support or any additional enhancements beyond the basic gameplay?
5. Do you have any specific code structure or organization preferences for the project?

Once I have these details, I can create the project structure in a new "tetris" directory and proceed accordingly.
gptcli/tetris> ```
1. graphical interface
2. windowed. SDL is fine
3. rotation. no hard drops. no scoring. no levels. lets start with the basics.
4. not yet.
5. no follow best practices as appropriate.
```
gptcli: processing...
gptcli would like to 'file_create'('&{tetris/main.go package main
...<main.go contents>...
allow? (Y/N) [N]: Y
gptcli would like to 'cmd_run'('&{mkdir [-p tetris]}')
allow? (Y/N) [N]: Y
gptcli would like to 'file_create'('&{tetris/main.go package main
...<main.go contents>...
allow? (Y/N) [N]: Y
The new Tetris project is being created in the "tetris" directory with a basic SDL implementation in Go. It features a single "T-piece" that supports rotation (with bounds checking) and simple gravity. Additional details like wall kicks, hard drops, scoring, levels, and sound are omitted per your instructions.

Please let me know if you would like any modifications or additional features.
gptcli/tetris> exit
gptcli> ls
